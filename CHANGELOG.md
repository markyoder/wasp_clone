- Convenience function is_override to check HIT key values for override specifier
- Python extension binding for wasplsp with server and connection implementations
- Ability to enable LSP snippet capability in wasplsp/ClientImpl via `enableSnippetSupport()`
- wasplsp::SnippetManager and supporting classes for single tabstop and placeholder interactions

### Fixed
- WASP build error when used as TPL caused by missing waspcore/wasp_bug.h include

## [4.3.0] - 5-03-2024

### Added
- LSP client and server support for both sending and receiving document hover text requests and responses
- Python WaspNode.source method to provide access to stream or file path originating the node
- Python WaspNode.isDecorative method to allow identification of decorative nodes (e.g., `{`,`,`,`decl`, etc.)

### Changed
- LSP IOStreamConnection to handle turning off and on standard output when needed
- EDDI comment logic where subsequent comments committed staged components
- TreeNodePool node_token_line now recursively finds first leaf if node is not already a leaf, instead of returning illegal line number (0)

- HIT error recovery for partial block such that parse tree construction resumes if possible, but parse failures are still captured
- Convenience function is_nested_file that checks if any NodeView is file include
- BLANK_LINE enum type and NodeView::set_type method to set type for any NodeView
- HITNodeView::token_type method to return the type of the backing token or UNKNOWN for non-terminal or out-of-range requests
