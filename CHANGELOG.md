### Fixed
 - Interpreter root and node_at to return a null view for no nodes

 - NodeView::set_data method to allow modification of leaf node data in HIT, DDI, EDDI, Halite, JSON, and SON
 - DISABLE_HIT_TYPE_PROMOTION configuration option that lets MOOSE turn off WASP's object name override logic

### Fixed

### Added
 - HIT support for `!include filepath`
 - SON support for `import("filepath")

## [2.0.2] - 03-01-2022

 - EDDI input parser to cache staged non-decorative nodes to avoid expensive node-count loop
 - EDDI input Lexer to be 8-bit to support identifying Unicode characters
 - Refacted GetPot into the latest MOOSE-revised Hierarchical Input Text (HIT) - breaks backward compatibility

 - support for HIT shorthand object notation '[x/y/z]'
 - support for commas in HIT strings
 - support for double-quoted strings in HIT documents
 - support for more than one input and template file in waspdrive input

## [1.0.3] - 10-07-2019
### Added
- GCC 5.4 compiler compatibility CI job.
- wasplsp - Language Server Protocol package with WaspServer and LSPInterpreter. See WASPLSP readme for details.

- waspeddi hanging comment (comment 1 or more lines below the last parameter) logic to reparent to the block

### Fixed

## [1.0.0] - 05-11-2018
### Added
- Typedefs for Default TokenPool,TreeNodePool, and Interpreters.
- Hierarchical data attribute references in HALITE. I.e., `<object.key.value>`

### Changed
- The TreeNodeView has been refactored to be NodeView and free of template parameters. This breaks backward compatibility

- missing support for `+` in ddi integer token lex pattern

## [0.1.2] - 01-22-2018
### Added
- The SON syntax now supports a 'block', ([blockname]) syntax which acts the same

compatibility with INI/Config and the NEK5000 PAR input formats.
- A clang-format style standard and updated code accordingly
- A SON2JSON routine and utility that allows conversion and validation
of SON input to JSON. This allows for validated input use in Python.

the literal delimiter.
